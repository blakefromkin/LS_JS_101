Example pseudo code for program that returns the sum of two numbers.
  First, casual:

  Intake two numbers provided by the user.
  Add the first number and the second number and store the sum to a variable.
  Return that variable.

  Now, formal:

  START
  GET first number from user
  GET second number from user

  SET sum = first number + second number

  RETURN sum
  END


  Example pseudocode that has: a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

  First, casual:

  Have the function take the string and character as arguments.
  Create a variable that stores how many times the character has appeared so far in the string.
  Iterate over the string, adding 1 to the counter variable each time our character argument appears.
  When the counter reaches 3, break the loop and return the iterator's value.

  Now, formal:

  GET str from user
  GET char from user.

  SET counter = 0
  FOR iterator over the full length of str
  IF the value at str[iterator] === char
  counter += 1
  IF counter = 3
  RETURN iterator

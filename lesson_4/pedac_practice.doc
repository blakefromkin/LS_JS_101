input: string
output: array of substrings
explicit requirements:
  - all palindromic substrings should be added to an array which is returned
  - palindromes are case sensitive
implicit requirements:
  - an empty string should return an empty string


PROBLEM: Given a string, return a new string with every other word review
input: string
output: new string
explicit requirements:
  - Output must be a string
  - That string must have every other word from the original string removed
implicit requirements:
  - An empty string should return an empty string
Questions:
  - What do we mean by every other word? Should that start with the first word?
  - How do we define "word" in this context?

The last number in each row n is n * (n + 1). So:
let sum = n * (n + 1);
for (let idx = n; idx > 0; idx--) {
  sum += sum - 2;
}

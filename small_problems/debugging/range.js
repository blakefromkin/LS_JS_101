/*
PROBLEM
We are assigned the task to implement a range function that returns an array of integers beginning and ending with specified start and end numbers. When only a single argument is provided, that argument should be used as the ending number and the starting number should be 0.

Check our code below. Why do the example invocations fail with an error saying Maximum call stack size exceeded? Can you fix the code, so it runs without error and satisfies the requirements?
*/

// ORIGINAL BUGGY CODE
function range(start, end = -1) {
  let range = [];

  for (let element = start; element <= end; element++) {
    range.push(element);
  }

  return range;
}

function range(end) {
  return range(0, end);
}
// Seems like this code tries to write two separate functions depending on the # of arguments? That's wrong. Correct would be:
function range(end, start = 0) { // Arguments changed
  let range = [];

  for (let element = start; element <= end; element++) {
    range.push(element);
  }

  return range;
}


// Examples

console.log(range(10, 20));
console.log(range(5));

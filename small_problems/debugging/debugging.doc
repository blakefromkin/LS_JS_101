Q1: Why does this throw a TypeError, saying: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined?
let ladder = ''

['head', 'heal', 'teal', 'tell', 'tall', 'tail'].forEach(word => {
  if (ladder !== '') {
    ladder += '-'
  }

  ladder += word
})

console.log(ladder)  // expect: head-heal-teal-tell-tall-tail

ANSWER: Missing semicolon after line 2


Q3: One bored and hungry evening we decided to randomly generate recipes. We can't wait to see the first suggestions, but JavaScript raises a TypeError, telling us that dishName.join is not a function. What is wrong?

(See random.js for code)

ANSWER: Trying to combine arrays with + when you should combine strings. This leads to the code trying to use join on a string, which doesn't work

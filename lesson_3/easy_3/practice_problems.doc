Question 2: What will the following code output?
console.log([1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]);
ANSWER: 1,2,34,5 (you can't use + to concatenate arrays, it makes them strings)

Question 3: What will the following code output?
let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";

ANSWER: hello there

Question 4: What will the following code output?
let arr1 = [{ first: "value1" }, { second: "value2" }, 3, 4, 5];
let arr2 = arr1.slice();
arr2[0].first = 42;
console.log(arr1);
ANSWER: It will change the value of "first" in the first object! While arr2 is a different array, the objects within the two arrays are the same objects!!
